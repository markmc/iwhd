To Do - priority (1 highest) work (5 largest) desc:
	1 1 policy inheritance
	1 2 delete metadata as well as data
	1 3 re-replicate on policy change (single object)
	--- done
	2 2 manual re-replication trigger
	2 4 writes proxied upstream
	3 3 content types
	3 3 get rid of strtok
	3 4 re-replicate on policy change (default)
	3 5 replicated DB
	4 2 check for existence before queuing repl job
	4 2 use MongoDB C driver now that it's supported
	4 3 chunked encoding
	4 5 immediate inline replication
	4 5 fully modular FS/S3/CF driver structure
	4 5 generate MongoDB queries from ours
	5 2 deletes proxied upstream
	5 3 cache control (TTL?)
	partial-object reads
	partial-object writes?
