To Do - priority (1 highest) work (5 largest) desc:
	1 1 policy inheritance
	1 2 delete metadata as well as data
	1 3 re-replicate on policy change (single object)
	2 2 manual re-replication trigger
	2 1 re-replicate on *any* tag change
	--- done
	1 5 auth
	2 1 start own MongoDB
	2 2 reverse-replication API
	2 3 replication-complete API
	2 3 statistics/usage API
	2 4 writes proxied upstream
	2 5 dynamic config
	2 5 reconcile dispatch with commands/format above
	3 3 VMWare back end
	3 3 content types
	3 3 fix string handling (eliminate strtok)
	3 4 EBS back end
	3 4 RHEV back end
	3 4 re-replicate on policy change (default)
	3 4 start own Hail
	3 5 replicated DB
	4 1 direct-copy API (PUT with special header?)
	4 2 check for existence before queuing repl job
	4 2 use MongoDB C driver now that it's supported
	4 3 chunked encoding
	4 4 optimize re-replication (check current locs)
	4 5 immediate inline replication
	4 5 fully modular FS/S3/CF driver structure
	4 5 generate MongoDB queries from ours
	5 2 deletes proxied upstream
	5 3 cache control (TTL?)
	partial-object reads
	partial-object writes?
